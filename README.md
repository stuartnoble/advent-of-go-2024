# Advent of Go 2024

> [!NOTE]
> Currently a work in progress

Welcome to my personal repository of Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Go.

This is my first time writing Go, using Advent of Code (better late then never) to provide some structure around my learning activities. 

I'm aware that some implementations may be less than optimal. The point of this challenge is to try and figure out my own answers from API documentation, blogs, and Stack Overflow answers so hopefully the knowledge should stick.

To run this application:
```shell
make
```
