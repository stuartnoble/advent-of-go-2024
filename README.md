# Advent of Go 2024

Welcome to my personal repository of Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Go.

This is my first time writing Go, using Advent of Code (better late then never) to provide some structure around my learning activities. I'm aware that some implementations may be less than optimal!

To run this application:
```shell
make
```
